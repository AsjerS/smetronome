A simple metronome application made in Rust.

## Installation
To install the program, press the "Releases" button somewhere on the right, and download `smetronome.exe` from there. To run it, you can either double-click the file, or run it via the command prompt.

## Modifications
You can edit the parameters in `assets/generate.py` and run it to get a new .wav click file if you want to change how the metronome sounds, which will be used when building the application. You could also upload your own .wav file in the `assets/` directory.
